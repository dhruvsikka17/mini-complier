# mini-c-compiler


This is a mini compiler for a subset of the C language built as part of our Compiler Design Lab Course of 6th semester.

It has been built as a series of four incremental phases, each contributing a key part of the compiler.

| Phase     | Objective                                                                                    |

| Project-1 | Building a lexical analyser using Lex for a subset of C language to tokenise a given program |
| Project-2 | Building a parser using Yacc by reading tokens from the lexical analyser from Project-1      |
| Project-3 | Building a semantic analyser for the context free grammar implemented in Project-2           |
| Project-4 | Building an Intermediate Code Generator                                                      |
